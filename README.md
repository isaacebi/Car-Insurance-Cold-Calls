## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI system designed to assist companies in optimizing their car insurance sales processes using acquired or gathered databases. The concept is reminiscent of the Iron Man movie, where Tony Stark seamlessly seeks assistance from Jarvis. In this scenario, salespeople have their own "Jarvis" to enhance their operational efficiency and effectiveness.

## Problem Statement

The task is to predict for customers who were contacted during the current campaign, **whether they will buy car insurance or not**.

## Dataset

The datasets can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kondla/carinsurance)
> We are looking at cold call results. Turns out, the same salespeople called existing insurance customers up and tried to sell car insurance. What you have are details about the called customers. Their age, job, marital status, whether they have home insurance, a car loan, etc.
